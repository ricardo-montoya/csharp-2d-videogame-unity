## About
This is the video game that I programmed during my last months at CECyT 3 and that allowed me to obtain the title of computer technician; Where I applied my knowledge in object-oriented programming and databases mainly. The project was totally programmed by me, with support from my colleagues in aspects such as designs and composition of the original music tracks.
Unfortunately I lost the source code of the project and could only rescue the executable file.
It runs on windows 10 / 11 and you can safely download it.
resources used
- OOP C#
- Unity 3D
- MariaDB for SQL databases

For the same reason, it is no longer possible for me to recreate the database used at the time of the presentation of the project.
